# Maintenance - Failure Prediction
---

* **Background:** What company/organization is the project developed for? Which business process or processes will be impacted by the project?

  None of the candidate companies agreed to provide their approval and allow the use of their databases for this project. Therefore, we requested authorization to use a publicly available dataset from an organization that provides such datasets. Attached is the reference to the Kaggle public dataset with the following link: [Kaggle Predictive Maintenance Dataset AI4I 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephanmatzka/predictive-maintenance-dataset-ai4i-2020).

  The project focuses on improving equipment maintenance by leveraging sensor data and technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Traditionally, repairs are performed after a failure occurs, which can be costly and lead to downtime. However, with advancements in current technology, we can anticipate these failures through data analysis. By employing machine learning algorithms, we can identify patterns in sensor data and predict problems before they happen, allowing for preventive rather than reactive maintenance. This approach helps avoid expensive repairs and minimize downtime, resulting in significant resource savings.

* **Problem Statement:** What is the problem being addressed?

  The problem to be solved is to avoid costly repairs and unplanned downtime in equipment maintenance by using sensor data and modern technologies to predict equipment failures before they occur.

  This predictive approach allows for maintenance to be performed before failures happen, optimizing operational efficiency and reducing the costs associated with reactive repairs.
